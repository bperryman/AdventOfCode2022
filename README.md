# Advent of code 2022

My attempts at solving the advent of code problems in 2022.

I'll put a folder in for each day and each folder should contain a file that can be loaded into lisp - I have a logical translation setup for quicklisp of "ql" so there will be a (load "ql:setup") in each file, you probably won't need that.
